    "The assignment is focused on solving the Forest Cover Type Prediction: https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/overview. This task proposes a classification problem: predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data).\n",

    "The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. You are asked to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are:\n",
